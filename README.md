# Number Sums Clone 🧩

A terminal-based logic puzzle game inspired by the popular mobile game "Number Sums". Developed in **C**, this project focuses on algorithmic logic, memory management, and data persistence.

## 📋 About the Project

This application recreates the core mechanics of *Number Sums*, where the player must select numbers in a grid that add up to specific target sums on the sides (rows and columns).

It was built to practice:
- **Modular Software Design:** Clean and structured code within a single compilation unit.
- **Data Persistence:** The game saves player rankings and high scores using file handling (`.txt` or binary files), ensuring data is not lost after the program closes.
- **Logic & Algorithms:** Efficient implementation of the game rules and board validation.
